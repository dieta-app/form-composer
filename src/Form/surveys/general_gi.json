We'll ask which symptoms you experience, and what you've tried successfully or unsuccessfully to do to resolve them. After you finish, our system will process the results using an algorithm developed by gastroenterologists, dietitians, and data scientists to give you your first personalized recommendations. As you track more data in the app, our AI will improve over time and be able to give you more specific recommendations for how you can improve your symptoms with new diets, medications, supplements, or lifestyle changes.</p>"
